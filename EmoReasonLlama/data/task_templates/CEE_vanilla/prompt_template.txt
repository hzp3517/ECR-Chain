Please recognize emotion cause for a given conversation.

In a given conversation, each utterance contains its index number, speaker, emotion, and its content, written in this format: `#[index number]: [speaker] ([emotion]): ["content"]`. Besides, a target non-neutral utterance will be specified, where the emotion of the target non-neutral utterance may be one of the types of [happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust]. You should predict which particular utterances in the conversation history (including the target itself) are causal utterances that are responsible for the non-neutral emotion in the target utterance. Output the index number of the causal utterances in the form of Python list.
